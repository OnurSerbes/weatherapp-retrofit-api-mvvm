# weatherapp-retrofit-api-mvvm
In this project, you will see an API manipulation prepared under the "MVVM" architecture and arranged using the "Retrofit"library.
As you can see in the project build there is a different packages for each architecture part. Which are "model, repository, viewmodel"
I have custom interface function to get some of my queries from the user ( The api by the programmer, city name from the user ).
You can see the "API Key" code line at the top of "Main Activity" it is raedy to be customize

I hope this project was helpful to you.
Have a nice coding
